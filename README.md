A sample project with

1.  a dummy javascript function
2.  a few Jasmine test cases for this dummy function
3.  minimum Karma configuration with coverage reporter
4.  gulp file which will trigger Karma run


Try

    npm install
    npm test

and it will generate a coverage file under coverage folder, naming lcov.info.

Send it to SonarQube and you will see your coverage.
